							<h1>The Singing Office</h1>
							<p>The Singing Office is a television series hosting by ex-Spice Girl Melanie Brown and ex-NSync member Joey Fatone that features ordinary citizens who form singing groups in their workplaces and then compete against teams from other offices. Groups of contestants were chosen with the five best coworkers representing their office. Each group of contestants had vocal coaches and choreographers before they competed against each other in front of a live studio audience. Travis Payne, Taylor Dayne, and Jon Secada judged the contestants and the winning team received $50,000.</p>
